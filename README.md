Witchy Spell Generator â€“ Project Description

Purpose:

Create personalized magical spells based on user input describing their problems, wishes, or desires.

Provide an immersive, interactive experience with spooky/fantasy visuals.

Core Technology:

Character-level RNN (LSTM):

Trained on a curated dataset of witchy poems and incantations.

Generates sequences of text character by character, capturing the style and rhythm of mystical language.

Uses temperature to control creativity: low temperature = predictable text, high temperature = more creative and varied spells.

Features:

Users can type their problem or wish in a text area.

Generates a customized spell in real-time.

Adjustable spell length and creativity settings.

Interactive Streamlit interface with spooky or Halloween-themed Lottie animations.

Output displayed in a text area for easy reading and sharing.

Technical Highlights:

Python & PyTorch: Core RNN model implementation.

Streamlit: Web interface for easy deployment.

Lottie Animations: Enhances user experience with animated magical visuals.

Error Handling: Ensures the model handles unexpected characters gracefully.

Impact:

Demonstrates AI-powered creative text generation.

Blends machine learning, web interactivity, and thematic storytelling.

Can be extended for more personalized experiences, like mood-based spell generation or theme detection.
